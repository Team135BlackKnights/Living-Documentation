### Instructions for Students

1. **Course Setup**  
   - Begin by reviewing the **Course Setup** section carefully.
   - Confirm that you have [`onshape/setup.md`](onshape/setup.md) fully complete.
   - If you are entirely new to CAD, click **[New To CAD](https://frcdesign.org/learning-course/)**.  
   - If you are already familiar with CAD but new to Onshape, click **[New To Onshape](https://frcdesign.org/learning-course/)**.  

2. **Stage 1: Core Exercises**  
   - Complete **all exercises in Stage 1**, paying close attention to how the **Origin Cube** functions.  
   - Understanding the Origin Cube is critical—it is foundational for navigation, assembly alignment, and future stages.  

3. **Skipping Exercises**  
   - If any exercises feel repetitive, it is okay to move on—but do not skip just to finish quickly.  
   - The more you practice and absorb, the more you will be able to do in later stages.  

**Reminder:** Mastery of Stage 1 is essential. Take your time, observe details, and experiment when needed. Your future work in CAD and Onshape will rely heavily on these fundamentals.
