# Living Documentation
Where Penn Robotics stores its documentation that needs markdown or some feature of Github.

## Onshape Guides
Onshape guides can be found in the [`onshape/setup.md`](onshape/setup.md) file.  
Refer to that document for setup instructions and best practices.

## Adding New Sections
When contributing to this living documentation:
- Add a new top-level section using a second-level header (`##`).
- Keep section titles short and descriptive.
- Place detailed guides or long content in their own `.md` file inside the appropriate folder, then link to it here.
- Use consistent formatting (lists, code blocks, links) for clarity.
