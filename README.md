## Adding New Sections
When contributing to this documentation:

- Use a new **top-level section** with a second-level header (`##`).  
- Keep section titles **short and descriptive**.  
- If external resources like Google Slides or other tools are more appropriate, link to them here and provide guidance on navigating them.  
- For detailed guides or longer content, create a separate `.md` file in the relevant folder and link to it here.  
- Maintain **consistent formatting** (lists, code blocks, links) for clarity.  
- Simplify content wherever possible. These guides should be **self-explanatory**.
